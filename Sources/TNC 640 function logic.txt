Unconditional jumps
An unconditional jump is programmed by entering a conditional
jump whose condition is always true. Example:
FN 9: IF+10 EQU+10 GOTO LBL1

Abbreviations used:
IF : If
EQU : Equal to
NE : Not equal to
GT : Greater than
LT : Less than
GOTO : Go to
UNDEFINED : Undefined
DEFINED : Defined
